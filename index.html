               This page is intended to showcase my projects.
               My projects are mostly just things I find cool and have no guarantee to be useful to anyone or anything. 
               I hope someone enjoys them as much as I do.
               I am interested in automation, image processing, and proof-of-concept projects.

               My name is Jake, and I am fascinated by technology. 
               I became interested in the field of Computer Science as a senior in high school.
               One requirement for my pre-calculus class was a Ti-84 calculator. 
               During the class, someone showed me a quadratic formula program, and I was amazed. 
               Just a few lines of code could vastly improve and simplify my life. 
               I went on to create dozens of programs in Ti-Basic, and my addiction was formed.
               I have been learning and coding ever since.
